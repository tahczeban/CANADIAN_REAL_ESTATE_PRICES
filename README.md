***Topic:*** Real Estate in Canada

Which province is the best province to purchase a house in for investment/personal purposes?

How does household income determine housing selection and location?


***We chose this question because:***

-affordability concerns for first-time buyers/younger adults

-municipal/national housing: trending if housing supply meets demands

***Data Sources:*** Statistics Canada Tables:

-Residential property price index, quarterly

-Components of population change by census metropolitan area and census agglomeration, 2016 boundaries

-Total family income and characteristics of residential property owners by family type



***ML Model:*** decision tree with clusters

Preprocessing of data:  

-value_counts, delete nulls, make appropriate DF’s

-Create OneHotEncoder

-Fit encoder and produce encoded DF

-Rename encoded columns

-Merge DF’s

-Standardize Data

-Deep neural network coding with hidden layers

-Elbow curve for cluster determination

-stats?: mean, median, mode, SD, variance, accuracy-potential outliers to remove to improve ML model?

***Data Base:*** Postgres and SQL


***Vizualizations:*** Tableau, graphs, matrices, confusion matrix, Google Slides, Python/Vsc, Pandas

???How does immigration effect the residential property price index across Canada?
