 **General Topic: Real Estate in Canada**
 ________________________________

***OVERVIEW:***

The motivation for this project is to ultimately integrate all of the knowledge obtained and pertain it to real life situations utilizing statistics, data (pre)processing and Machine Learning (ML) procedures to create relevent and predictive models regarding this topic. The final model will be presented utilizing vizualizations for ease of conveying the aforementioned. A collaborative effort is being initiated to consider the topic of housing price indices, income, availability, and immigration across Canada, as this is a pertinent and essential topic among people in this day and age! 2011-2019

## **Questions with data:**

- does immigration or population have a greater impact on housing prices provincially, in Canada?-2x linear regression

- Which province is the best province to purchase a house in for investment/personal purposes?-tableau

- How does household income determine housing selection and location?-linear reg/TBD

- How does immigration effect the residential property price index across Canada?TBD

## **We chose this question because:**

- affordability concerns for first-time buyers/younger adults

- population alterations and migration trends across Canada

- municipal/national housing: trending if housing supply meets demands


## **Data Sources**

- Residential property price index, quarterly

***RESULTS:***

***DELIVERABLE 1***

The results for Deliverable 1 encompass team collaboration via slack and with the Teaching Staff, in order to accomplish the goals. GitHub establishment requirements will be met including: initialization of an appropriate repository, addition of all branches and a README. Additionally, cleaning and pre-processing the data will be considered. A 'mockup' database will be included, as well as a potential 'mockup' ML model. Lastly, an example ERD will be included for this submission to meet all requirements. A SCRUM method of approach will be contemplated in order to attain all goals with optimal results.

***DELIVERABLE 2***
