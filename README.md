***Topic:*** Real Estate in Canada

How does population change (immigration) effect the residential property price index across Canada?

How does household income determine housing selection and location?

-Components of population change by census metropolitan area and census agglomeration, 2016 boundaries

***ML Model:*** deep ML, as we do not know the prediction outcomes import dependencies and read the csv’s

Preprocessing of data:  

-value_counts, delete nulls, make appropriate DF’s

-Create OneHotEncoder

-Fit encoder and produce encoded DF

-Rename encoded columns

-Merge DF’s

-Standardize Data

-Deep neural network coding with hidden layers

-Elbow curve for cluster determination

-stats: mean, median, mode, SD, variance, accuracy

***Data Base:*** Postgres and SQL, AWS, S3 for joining tables and presenting post cleaning/preprocessing


***Vizualizations:*** Tableau, graphs, matrices, bootstrap, JavaScript, Google Slides, Python/Vsc, Pandas
