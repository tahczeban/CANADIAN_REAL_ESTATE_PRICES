## **Topic: Real Estate in Canada**



## **Questions with data**
- Which province is the best province to purchase a house in for investment/personal purposes?

- How does household income determine housing selection and location?


## **We chose this question because**

- affordability concerns for first-time buyers/younger adults

- population alterations and migration trends across Canada

- municipal/national housing: trending if housing supply meets demands


## **Data Sources**

- Residential property price index, quarterly

## **ML Model: decision tree with clusters**

Preprocessing of data:  

- value_counts, delete nulls, make appropriate DF’s

- Create OneHotEncoder

- Fit encoder and produce encoded DF

- Rename encoded columns

- Merge DF’s

- Standardize Data

- Deep neural network coding with hidden layers

- Elbow curve for cluster determination

- stats?: mean, median, mode, SD, variance, accuracy-potential outliers to remove to improve ML model?


## **Data Base**
Postgres and SQL


## **Vizualizations** 
Tableau, graphs, matrices, confusion matrix, Google Slides, Python/Vsc, Pandas
